            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
             During my internship with Overland, I was assigned to one of the most significant infrastructure renewal efforts within a coal-fired power generation plant—the replacement of an 80-foot coal chute system responsible for transporting raw fuel between primary conveyors and processing equipment. The original chute had been in continuous operation for decades, suffering from severe material wear, structural fatigue, and inefficiencies caused by outdated design standards. My objective was to revitalize the system using modern drafting practices, ensuring both the plant’s operational continuity and compliance with current safety and fabrication standards.

The project began with a comprehensive review of legacy documentation, which included a mix of deteriorated paper drawings and partial CAD files that were incomplete or dimensionally inconsistent. Many of the original design notes were hand-marked and had never been properly digitized. My first major responsibility was to reverse-engineer the entire assembly, carefully verifying dimensions from archived files, previous revision notes, and on-site field measurements. This effort resulted in a complete digital recreation of the chute system using AutoCAD, establishing a reliable foundation for future modifications, analysis, and fabrication. The project became a model example of how legacy systems can be brought into the modern engineering environment without disrupting existing plant operations.

            <h3>Design & Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              Once the baseline drawings were completed, I began the design refinement and modernization phase, where my focus shifted to both structural performance and manufacturability. The original design was built with heavy welded plate steel, riveted joints, and inconsistent bolt patterns, making repairs and maintenance unnecessarily difficult. Through the updated drawings, I restructured these elements with standardized hole spacing, reinforced mounting flanges, and more accessible service panels. These improvements ensured not only longer service life but also simplified assembly and disassembly during maintenance shutdowns.

Using AutoCAD, I drafted a comprehensive series of 2D orthographic and detail views, each verified against known tolerances and fabricator feedback. I refined internal geometries to improve coal flow dynamics, minimizing areas where material could accumulate and cause blockage or abrasion. Particular attention was given to high-impact corners and discharge areas, where I applied design modifications such as wear plates, smooth transition radii, and bolted access ports for easier inspection.

Throughout the process, I collaborated closely with senior mechanical and structural engineers to confirm the design met load-bearing, vibration, and thermal expansion requirements for a high-temperature, heavy-dust environment. This included ensuring compatibility with the existing conveyor systems and validating bolt-hole alignment for the mating flanges. Every drawing revision went through iterative reviews, emphasizing precision dimensioning, welding notation, and adherence to fabrication best practices. The result was a complete, modernized drawing package that could be sent directly to fabrication with minimal interpretation required on the shop floor—a crucial factor for large-scale steel assemblies of this nature.

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>
              With the final design package approved, I transitioned into a fabrication and implementation support role, which provided valuable hands-on exposure to the industrial build process. I worked directly with the fabrication shop team to walk through the new drawing sets, clarifying geometry details, weld symbols, and fit-up sequences. Because the chute’s massive scale required multiple subassemblies to be welded and bolted together on-site, I developed clear assembly notes and part numbering conventions that improved shop communication and reduced the potential for alignment errors.

During fabrication, I regularly verified progress and dimensional accuracy by cross-checking key structural members and connection points against the AutoCAD specifications. I was also involved in quality control observations, ensuring that weld integrity, plate alignment, and bolt-hole positioning adhered to design tolerances. When challenges arose—such as variations in plate thickness or discrepancies caused by material warping—I worked collaboratively with both the welders and project engineers to adjust the design and issue quick-turn drawing revisions.

Once fabrication concluded, I oversaw aspects of on-site assembly and installation, coordinating with the plant maintenance and construction crews. This required understanding how the chute would be hoisted, anchored, and aligned within existing infrastructure, all while minimizing downtime for the operating plant. Witnessing the final installation provided valuable insight into the practical interplay between design theory and field execution. It also demonstrated how proper documentation control and fabrication oversight are essential for large industrial installations where even small deviations can cascade into major fit-up or operational issues

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
              The completed project delivered a fully modernized coal chute assembly that successfully replaced the deteriorated legacy unit, restoring critical flow reliability within the plant’s fuel transport system. The redesign achieved several tangible performance improvements: smoother material flow, reduced wear in high-impact areas, and easier long-term maintenance through the addition of standardized bolting, modular sections, and inspection panels. The precise AutoCAD documentation allowed fabricators to build with minimal ambiguity, leading to an efficient production process with fewer field adjustments and shorter installation downtime.

From an engineering standpoint, the project served as a case study in legacy system digitization and lean documentation practice. The conversion from incomplete paper records to fully detailed AutoCAD drawings ensured that the plant’s maintenance and engineering departments would have a permanent, modifiable reference for future upgrades. This process not only enhanced the operational resilience of the coal handling system but also significantly improved traceability and technical clarity for future design revisions.

For me personally, the project provided deep, hands-on exposure to industrial-scale design, fabrication coordination, and field implementation. It strengthened my technical proficiency in AutoCAD, improved my ability to communicate effectively between design and production teams, and developed a keen understanding of how theoretical engineering translates into practical, real-world construction. The success of this project exemplified the value of precise documentation, disciplined communication, and continuous design improvement—core principles that continue to shape my approach as an emerging engineer focused on Lean Systems, mechanical integrity, and cross-functional efficiency.
