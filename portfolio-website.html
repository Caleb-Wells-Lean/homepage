          <div class="pd-copy"><h3>Overview</h3><p>The portfolio website project was developed to serve as my personal digital platform, designed to showcase my engineering background, technical projects, certifications, and professional growth in a clean and structured format. My primary goal was to create a site that embodied the same principles I follow in engineering work — efficiency, clarity, and precision. The visual theme draws inspiration from industrial minimalism, using a blue-gray palette, white contrast tones, and mechanical-inspired accents to reflect my background in Lean Systems and mechanical design. Every element was created with intent: to balance aesthetic simplicity with technical functionality. The website acts not only as a portfolio but as a reflection of my engineering mindset — methodical, data-driven, and detail-oriented.</p></div>

          <div class="pd-media"><img src="Image/CAD.webp" alt="Components"></div>
          <div class="pd-copy"><h3>Components</h3><p>The site is built entirely from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without reliance on heavy frameworks, giving me full control over layout, responsiveness, and performance. It’s structured around modular sections including a hero introduction, skills overview, project gallery, résumé integration, and contact form, each designed for both clarity and consistency. The layout employs flexbox and CSS grid systems to maintain structure across different screen sizes, while JavaScript handles the site’s interactivity — such as project tab switching, animated transitions, and smooth scrolling behavior.

Typography and color choices were selected for precision and balance; the use of Poppins font ensures clean readability, and careful spacing creates visual rhythm without clutter. The color scheme, built around deep blue-grays and light neutrals, maintains contrast and readability while tying into the mechanical and professional tone of the portfolio. Throughout the design process, I focused on accessibility, fast load times, and modular organization, allowing easy updates as new projects and certifications are added.</p></div>

          <div class="pd-media"><img src="Image/engineering-programing.webp" alt="Implementation"></div>
          <div class="pd-copy"><h3>Implementation</h3><p>The implementation process followed a structured, engineering-style workflow — starting with wireframing and layout planning, followed by iterative cycles of building, testing, and refining. I began with a simple HTML skeleton and gradually expanded into styled, responsive sections, continuously verifying layout performance across different devices and browsers. CSS was layered progressively to maintain modularity and ease of revision, while JavaScript was implemented only where necessary to improve usability and interactivity without bloating load times.

Throughout development, I treated the project as both a design exercise and a system optimization challenge. Every section was stress-tested for visual balance, scaling behavior, and text adaptability. The project also involved consistent review and adjustment of color contrast ratios, font weights, and element spacing to ensure legibility under varied lighting and display conditions. The final version of the portfolio site delivers a cohesive, professional presentation that is lightweight, responsive, and future-ready — an evolving platform that will continue to grow as I add new technical projects, documentation, and professional milestones.</p></div>
